# COW_TEAT_CLASSIFICATION


In this study, we describe the process of building, fitting,and applying a Convolutional Neural Network for a multi-classification task on images. The purpose of this researchis to develop a classification system that can identify thedegree of hyperkeratosis on cow teats by analyzing a col-lection of images. This is significant because hyperkerato-sis can impact the quality of milk produced by dairy cows.Through this work, we demonstrate how neural networkscan solve problems that are difficult for the human eye todiscern
